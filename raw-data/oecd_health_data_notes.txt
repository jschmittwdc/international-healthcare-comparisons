* Health expenditure and financing

A System of Health Accounts 2011 provides an updated and systematic 
description of the financial flows related to the consumption of 
healthcare goods and services. As demands for information increase and
more countries implement and institutionalise health accounts according
to the system, the data produced are expected to be more comparable, more 
detailed and more policy relevant. It builds on the original OECD Manual, 
published in 2000 to create a single global framework for producing health 
expenditure accounts that can help track resource flows from sources to uses. 
It is the result of a collaborative effort between the OECD, WHO and the 
European Commission, and sets out in more detail the boundaries, the 
definitions and the concepts – responding to healthcare systems around the 
globe – from the simplest to the more complicated. The accounting framework 
is organised around a tri-axial system for the recording of healthcare 
expenditure, namely classifications of the functions of healthcare (ICHA-HC), 
healthcare provision (ICHA-HP), and financing schemes (ICHA-HF).

* Potential years of life lost

Potential Years of Life Lost (PYLL) is a summary measure of premature 
mortality which provides an explicit way of weighting deaths occurring 
at younger ages, which are, a priori, preventable. The calculation of PYLL
involves summing up deaths occurring at each age and multiplying this with
 the number of remaining years to live up to a selected age limit. 
 The limit of 75 years has been chosen for the calculations in OECD Health 
 Statistics.

Frequency of observation: Annual
Measure: Potential years of life lostUnit of measure: Years per 100 000 persons
Age: 75 years
Topic: Health > Health status
